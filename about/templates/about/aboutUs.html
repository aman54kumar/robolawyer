        Just Bot aims to help complainants (and their lawyers) improve the
        quality of their applications to the European Court of Human Rights,
        currently many claims are rejected immediately, often for simple
        mistakes, and only 5% reach the stage of receiving a judgement. In the
        first phase, the project provides a digital tool in English that
        automates the standard procedure and provides help along the way. In the
        second phase, we aim to integrate different languages and algorithms to
        automate the writing process.
        <br />

        Just Bot is based on a partnership between Tech-R and CELL/NRCCL
        (Faculty of University of Oslo). We would like to especially thank
        Lovdata for financial support in the first phase and we are open to new
        partners joining as the project moves forward.
