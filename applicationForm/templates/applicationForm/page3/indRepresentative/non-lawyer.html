              eComms is a service initiated by the Court for communicating
              electronically with an applicant’s representative. The service is
              only activated if and when the case reaches a stage of the
              proceedings where the Government concerned are requested to submit
              written observations. The email address provided will be used to
              create an eComms account. It is recommended that representatives
              working in a law firm provide a generic email address so that the
              account can be used by multiple users within the firm. You should
              inform the Court of any change to your eComms account email
              address. For more information, please refer to the terms and
              conditions available on the eComms website
              (https://ecomms.echr.coe.int), as well as the Practice Direction

          An applicant must sign the authority empowering the representative to
          act on his or her behalf, unless, for example, the applicant is a
          child or lacks legal capacity and is unable to sign. If a
          representative who is not a lawyer has instructed a lawyer on behalf
          of an applicant who is unable to sign, the representative should sign
          the authority on the applicant’s behalf. A separate authority form
          will not be accepted unless adequate explanations are provided as to
          the existence of insurmountable practical obstacles in signing the
          authority section on the form or it is used at a later stage to
          appoint a lawyer/representative after the application has been lodged
          with the Court.

            If an applicant is represented by a lawyer or other person, both the
            applicant and the designated representative – whose identifying
            details must be indicated on the application form - must sign the
            authority section on the application form. The applicant’s signature
            provides the necessary proof that the representative has been
            authorised by the applicant to act on the latter’s behalf; the
            representative’s signature, which is a new requirement, provides
            confirmation that this person has in fact accepted to act for the
            applicant. Where the applicant is an organisation, it is the
            official or officer of that organisation and the lawyer who sign. In
            the absence of such signature, the Registry may continue to
            correspond only with the applicant due to lack of proof that the
            representative is in fact involved in the case.
