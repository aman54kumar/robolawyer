      <h5 class="ajustify">
        An applicant must sign the authority empowering the representative
        to act on his or her behalf, unless, for example, the applicant is a
        child or lacks legal capacity and is unable to sign. If a
        representative who is not a lawyer has instructed a lawyer on behalf
        of an applicant who is unable to sign, the representative should
        sign the authority on the applicant’s behalf. A separate authority
        form will not be accepted unless adequate explanations are provided
        as to the existence of insurmountable practical obstacles in signing
        the authority section on the form or it is used at a later stage to
        appoint a lawyer/representative after the application has been
        lodged with the Court.

          If an applicant is represented by a lawyer or other person, both
          the applicant and the designated representative – whose
          identifying details must be indicated on the application form -
          must sign the authority section on the application form. The
          applicant’s signature provides the necessary proof that the
          representative has been authorised by the applicant to act on the
          latter’s behalf; the representative’s signature, which is a new
          requirement, provides confirmation that this person has in fact
          accepted to act for the applicant. Where the applicant is an
          organisation, it is the official or officer of that organisation
          and the lawyer who sign. In the absence of such signature, the
          Registry may continue to correspond only with the applicant due to
          lack of proof that the representative is in fact involved in the
          case.

        eComms is a service initiated by the Court for communicating
        electronically with an applicant’s representative. The service
        is only activated if and when the case reaches a stage of the
        proceedings where the Government concerned are requested to
        submit written observations. The email address provided will be
        used to create an eComms account. It is recommended that
        representatives working in a law firm provide a generic email
        address so that the account can be used by multiple users within
        the firm. You should inform the Court of any change to your
        eComms account email address. For more information, please refer
        to the terms and conditions available on the eComms website
        (https://ecomms.echr.coe.int), as well as the Practice Direction
        on electronic filing by applicants
