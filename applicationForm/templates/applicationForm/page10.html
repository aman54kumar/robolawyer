                        This page contains some of the most general conditions
                        that you have to fulfill in order for your application
                        to be complete and admissible. These include: the
                        country you are complaining against, information about
                        exhausting the domestic judicial remedies, the date when
                        the acts took place and the date when you received the
                        final judgement for the highest domestic court competent
                        to deal with your case. This information is required in
                        order to determine whether the country you intend to
                        complain against was under obligations pursuant to the
                        European Convention on Human Rights at the time when the
                        facts took place and to determine whether you are
                        complying with two important rules of the European Court
                        of Human Rights. These rules concern your duty to
                        exhaust all available and effective national remedies
                        before sending an application to the ECtHR and your duty
                        to send the application to the ECtHR within 6 months
                        from receiving a final judgement. If you have not
                        exhausted all available national remedies or you send
                        your application to ECtHR more than 6 months from the
                        moment you received the final judgement from the highest
                        national court competent to deal with your case, then
                        your application will most probably be considered
                        inadmissible.

                        In this page you must inform the case on whether you
                        have a representative or not. At this point in the
                        application process you do not need a lawyer, although
                        if your application is complete and reaches a judicial
                        stage where the chamber organizes hearings, then the
                        ECtHR will expect you to be represented by a lawyer. The
                        Court will inform you in good time if this is the case.
                        <br />
                        It is common that in the case of an applicant who is
                        physically or legally unable to lodge the application,
                        there is a non-lawyer who represents the applicant, for
                        example in the case of children or persons who have
                        disappeared. Either the applicant or a non-lawyer
                        representative of an applicant may give power of
                        attorney to a lawyer. In the case where the applicant
                        has a representative, both the applicant and the
                        representative must sign the authority form giving the
                        representative the power to represent the applicant.

                        One of the reasons why the European Court of Human

                        seek remedy for your complaints.

                        In this page you must list all the documents related to
                        your case.The European Court of Human Rights expects to
                        receive a chronologically arranged list with the name,
                        description and page numbers of each document, as well
                        as copies of the listed documents. For this reason you
                        must make a list of all the documents you want to submit
                        to the Court in order to support your claims (decisions,
                        medical reports, witness statements and other material
                        you might deem necessary). Using the information you
                        enter on this page, the digital application form will
                        automatically determine the order and consecutive page
                        numbers of your documents: you just enter the date and
                        page numbers, and it will calculate automatically where
                        in the accompanying documents folder each document can
                        be found. Before you send the application form to the
                        European Court of Human Rights you still have to
                        manually gather the documents, arrange them according to
                        the list of documents on page 12 of the PRINTED FORM.
                        You also have to number the pages of each document
                        consecutively and add them in order in the envelope
                        containing your application. <br />
                        Please be advised that the European Court of Human
                        Rights has very specific requirements for how the
                        accompanying documents should be arranged: <br />
                        they should be arranged by date and procedure. <br />
                        the pages of all documents must be numbered
                        consecutively, similarly to how chapters in a book are
                        numbered. When you generate the printable application
                        form from Justbot, you will receive separator pages for
                        each document that you listed. The separator pages
                        contain the title and description of each document, as
                        well as the start and end page number for each document
                        and they will guide you in numbering the pages of your
                        documents. <br />
                        you must not staple, bind or tape the documents.

                        <br />
                        Please note that the European Court of Human Rights will
                        not open and it will destroy any package that is deemed
                        suspicious.
