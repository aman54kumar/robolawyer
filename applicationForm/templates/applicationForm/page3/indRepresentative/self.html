    Even though you do not need a lawyer at this stage, if/when
    the application enters a judicial stage and hearings of the
    case are scheduled, the Court will expect the applicant to be
    represented by a trained lawyer. Depending on the
    particularities of the application, it might take up to
    several years until the application enters the judicial phase
    and hearings are scheduled. The Court will inform you if this
    is the case and if you need to contract a lawyer. If you wish
    to represent yourself in the Chamber hearings or you do not
    afford a lawyer, the President of the Chamber may offer
    special dispensation for you to present your own case in
    accordance to Rule 36, or you may be granted free legal aid in
    the conditions specified by Rule 105 (former Rule 100).
