            An applicant must sign the authority empowering the representative to act
            on his or her behalf, unless, for example, the applicant is a child or
            lacks legal capacity and is unable to sign. If a representative who is not

            to sign, the representative should sign the authority on the applicant’s
            behalf. A separate authority form will not be accepted unless adequate
            explanations are provided as to the existence of insurmountable practical
            obstacles in signing the authority section on the form or it is used at a
            later stage to appoint a lawyer/representative after the application has

              must be indicated on the application form - must sign the authority
              section on the application form. The applicant’s signature provides the
              necessary proof that the representative has been authorised by the
              applicant to act on the latter’s behalf; the representative’s signature,
              which is a new requirement, provides confirmation that this person has
              in fact accepted to act for the applicant. Where the applicant is an
              organisation, it is the official or officer of that organisation and the
              lawyer who sign. In the absence of such signature, the Registry may
              continue to correspond only with the applicant due to lack of proof that
              the representative is in fact involved in the case.
