    <h5 class="ajustify">
      An applicant must sign the authority empowering the representative
      to act on his or her behalf, unless, for example, the applicant is a
      child or lacks legal capacity and is unable to sign. If a
      representative who is not a lawyer has instructed a lawyer on behalf
      of an applicant who is unable to sign, the representative should
      sign the authority on the applicant’s behalf. A separate authority
      form will not be accepted unless adequate explanations are provided
      as to the existence of insurmountable practical obstacles in signing
      the authority section on the form or it is used at a later stage to
      appoint a lawyer/representative after the application has been
      lodged with the Court.

        If an applicant is represented by a lawyer or other person, both
        the applicant and the designated representative – whose
        identifying details must be indicated on the application form -
        must sign the authority section on the application form. The
        applicant’s signature provides the necessary proof that the
        representative has been authorised by the applicant to act on the
        latter’s behalf; the representative’s signature, which is a new
        requirement, provides confirmation that this person has in fact
        accepted to act for the applicant. Where the applicant is an
        organisation, it is the official or officer of that organisation
        and the lawyer who sign. In the absence of such signature, the
        Registry may continue to correspond only with the applicant due to
        lack of proof that the representative is in fact involved in the
        case.
