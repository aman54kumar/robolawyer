Engl.\n<br/>\nIn addition to the reservation to Article 1 of the First Protocol, made in accordance with Article 64 of the Convention, the Republic of Latvia hereby gives a brief summary of the laws concerned.\n<br/>\nThe goal of the Law On Land Reform in the Republic of Latvia Rural Regions is to allocate the land for paying use to natural persons and legal persons and to renew to the Republic of Latvia citizens, who desire so, the land ownership rights in the procedure stipulated by law or to deliver the land into ownership without compensation or for pay.\n<br/>\nThe Law On Privatisation of Agricultural Enterprises and Collective Fisheries regulates privatisation of agricultural enterprises and collective fisheries. The objective of the Law is to decrease sequels of unlawful methods of collectivisation changing the forms of property in agricultural enterprises and collective fisheries as well as to promote the process of privatisation in agriculture and development of private entrepreneurial activity.\n<br/>\nThe aim of the Law On Land Reform in the Republic of Latvia Cities, during the gradual process of State property denationalisation, conversion, privatisation and the return of unlawfully expropriated land, is to restructure the legal, social and economic relations between city land owners and users in order to promote the respective city's construction, land protection and its rational utilisation in accordance with the interests of society.\n<br/>\nThe main objectives of the Law On Land Privatisation in Rural Regions are:<br/>\n1. to create a basis and guarantees for agricultural development;<br/>\n2. to renew land ownership rights to the former landowners who owned the land on July 21, 1940 or their heirs; and<br/>\n3. to give the land into ownership of the Republic of Latvia citizens for compensation.\n<br/>\nThe Law On Privatisation of Property in Agroservice Enterprises regulates the change of ownership rights on property under the use and disposal of agroservice enterprises. The main objective of the Law is to promote the development of entrepreneurial activity in this branch by property privatisation, and to create conditions for organisation of the system for protection of the interests of agricultural producers on the basis of co-operation and competition.\n<br/>\nThe Law establishes the rights of the State and local self-governments, agricultural producers and employees of an enterprise, as well as of other natural persons and legal persons, and the procedure by which the ownership rights on the property under use and disposal of agroservice enterprise shall be obtained or specified.\n<br/>\nThe goal of the Law On Privatisation Certificates is to establish a legal basis for most of Latvia's residents to participate in the process of privatisation of State and local self-government owned property, using privatisation certificates as form of payment.\n<br/>\nCertificates are issued to Latvia's residents according to the years of residence in Latvia. Additional certificates can be issued to former owners or their heirs, as compensation for illegally nationalised real estate which cannot be returned; politically repressed persons who are recognised as such, according to the Republic of Latvia Law of May 13, 1992 \"On the Determination of the Status of a Politically Repressed Person\", corresponding to time of imprisonment, deportation or time of settling.\n<br/>\nThe Law On the Privatisation of Objects of State and Municipal Property determines the procedure for privatisation of objects of State and local self-government property, as far as it is not regulated by other laws, as well as the establishment and operational principles of the Latvian Privatisation Agency.\n<br/>\nThe Law On Privatisation of Co-operative Apartments establishes the legal basis for the privatisation of the co-operative dwelling fund of house-building co-operatives in the territory of the Republic of Latvia. Apartments in large dwelling houses owned by house-building co-operatives shall be considered as the object of privatisation.\n<br/>\nThe Law On the Privatisation of State and Local Self-Governments Apartment Houses establishes the procedure for privatising State and local self-government apartment houses, and the goal is to develop the real estate market and stimulate the upkeep of apartment houses, while protecting the interests of residents. <br/> The Law On Denationalisation of Real Estate defines the real estate which can be denationalised, fixes the terms and procedure of denationalisation, the form of compensation and social guarantees of present tenants. <br/> The Law On the Return of Real Estate to the Legitimate Owners guarantees that the real estate which has been expropriated by the State in the 1940s-1980s without compensation will be returned to the former owners or their legal heirs.", "Latvia temporarily derogated from certain obligations under Article 2 of Protocol 1 during the COVID-19 pandemic.
