                                Applicants have to support their complaints by documentary
                                evidence. This means that if there is a complaint about an
                                official act or decision, a copy of that decision or document
                                attesting to that official act or measure must be provided. The
                                Court cannot just take the word of applicants for what they say
                                has happened. So, if an applicant complains that his house is
                                being expropriated, he must attach to the application form a
                                copy of the official decision ordering the expropriation; if an
                                applicant alleges that she has been refused legal aid for her
                                child custody proceedings, she must provide a copy of the
                                document by the decision body setting out that refusal. If there
                                are a number of documents relating to a particular incident or
                                procedure, an applicant should err on the side of caution and
                                provide all that appear relevant. <br /><br />
                                If you are unable to obtain a copy of a decision or document,
                                you should explain this in the application form. But you must
                                show that it was practically impossible for you to obtain the
                                document: applicants are expected to take reasonable steps to
                                apply to authorities for copies of documents and to comply with
                                reasonable formalities in that respect. If the explanation is
                                not forthcoming or adequate, the application will not be
                                allocated to a judicial formation.
                                <br /><br />
                                Where documents are provided by electronic means, they must be
                                in the format required by this practice direction; they must
                                also be arranged and numbered in accordance with the list of
                                documents on the application form.

                                <b>REMINDER:</b> It is the applicantâ€™s responsibility to take
                                steps in good time to obtain all the information and documents
                                required for a complete application. If you do not provide one
                                or more of the necessary documents your application will not be
