        Justbot aims to help applicants and their lawyers improve the quality of
        their applications to the European Court of Human Rights. Since 2014,
        over 30% of the applications processed by the Court were rejected as
        incomplete in the pre-judicial phase, and of those entering the judicial
        phase, only 5% reached the stage of receiving a judgement, while the
        large majority was declared inadmissible or struck out of the list. The
        development of Justbot is planned over several years and in several
        phases. In the first phase, this project provides a digital tool in
        English that automates the standard procedure and provides help along
        the way. In later phases, we aim to integrate different language
        versions and algorithms to automate the writing process. <br /><br />
        Justbot is based on a partnership between
        <a href="https://www.tech-r.org/" target="_blank">Technology for Human Rights (Tech-R)</a>
        and the
        <a href="https://www.uio.no/" target="_blank">Center for Experiential Legal Learning (CELL)</a>
        at the Faculty of Law, University of Oslo.<br /><br />
        Technology for Human Rights (Tech-R) is a non-profit organisation
        founded by graduates of the Norwegian Centre for Human Rights (UiO) and
        Informatics Institute (UiO). Tech-R is dedicated to finding ways of
        using technology for the protection and fulfilment of human rights, and
        this project is an important step in fulfilling our mission.
        <br /><br />
        The Center for Experiential Legal Learning (CELL) is a centre of
        excellence in education at the Faculty of Law (UiO) and it supports
        projects that combine law and technology. <br />
