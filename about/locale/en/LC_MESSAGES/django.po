"Justbot aims to help applicants and their lawyers improve the quality of "
"their applications to the European Court of Human Rights. Since 2014, over "
"30% of the applications processed by the Court were rejected as incomplete "
"in the pre-judicial phase, and of those entering the judicial phase, only 5% "
"reached the stage of receiving a judgement, while the large majority was "
"declared inadmissible or struck out of the list. The development of Justbot "
"is planned over several years and in several phases. In the first phase, "
"this project provides a digital tool in English that automates the standard "
"procedure and provides help along the way. In later phases, we aim to "
"integrate different language versions and algorithms to automate the writing "
"process."
